<a name="Exercise1"></a>
## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Cloud Shell (PowerShell) ##

The first step in .... In this exercise, you will create .....

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your browser. If you are asked to log in, do so using your Microsoft account.

2. Click on the **Cloud Shell** button at the top of the page

    ![Open Cloud Shell](Images/open-cloud-shell.png)

    > The Cloud Shell will appear at the bottom of the page

3. Click **PowerShell (Windows)**

    ![Select PowerShell](Images/select-powershell-windows.png)

4. Select your subscription, and Click on **Create storage**. This will create a new storage account for you and create a file share to persist files.

    ![Create default storage](Images/create-default-storage.png)

5. Your Azure Cloud Shell wil be ready within a few minutes. Make sure you choose Powershell. You can swith between Bash and Powershell in the dropdown list

    ![Connecting Cloud Shell](Images/connecting-cloud-powershell.png)

The Azure Cloud Shell is a window container. A new one will be started with your CloudDrive mapped as a volume. And you will be connected to your current Azure subscription. has been created and you have added three containers to the storage account created for it. The next step is to get code from this repo.



<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Clone GitHub repository ##

Once you have created an Azure Cloud Shell, you can use Powershell, commands, and some other SDK or application installed on it. In this exercise, you will clone the git repo into a persistent volume _CloudDrive_. This will allow you to get all the scripts necessary to create the assets. 

1. Type these commands to navigate to your CloudDrive and clone this git repository.

    > Copy and paste in Azure Cloud Shell
    >
    > - Windows: `Ctrl-insert` to copy and `Shift-insert` to paste. Right-click dropdown can also enable copy/paste.
    >   - FireFox/IE may not support clipboard permissions properly.
    > - Mac OS: `Cmd-c` to copy and `Cmd-v` to paste. Right-click dropdown can also enable copy/paste.

    ```powershell
    cd 
    git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/azugfr/functions-customer-reviews.git
    ```

    > _-depth 1 --single-branch_ options will limit download to the tip of master branch. The full history will not be downloaded. 

    ![cloning the git repo](Images/git-clone-functions-repo.png)

    â€‹

2.  Type this command to navigate inside the repo and list content.  

    ```powershell
    cd .\functions-customer-reviews\
    ls
    ```

    ![List content of repo](Images/list-functions-repo-content.png)



The folders doc and Media contain images and instructions for differents labs and demo. 
The Source folder contains source code of the sample. The Provision folder contains the scripts to create assets required for [lab 02](../02 - Visual Studio) and [lab 03](../03 - Continuous Delivery). 
The Reset folder contains the scripts to clean up and pre filled images. 

The next step is to create the assets that the Customer Reviews solution relies on.

<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Create assets with Azure Resource Manager template ##

The `Provision` folder contains an Azure Resource Manager template file [Provision\assets\template.json](). This file describe all the to be created Azure assets:

* Storage account
* CosmosDB is the evolution of DocumentDB. DocumentDB is still the name use in the template for asset name and variables.
* Cognitives Services Computer Vision (Image analysis)
* Cognitives Services Content Moderator (Text analysis)
* Azure Web Site
* Application Insights and a specific dashboard "Reviews Insights"
* Azure Function App

In this exercise, you will create these assets.

1. In the Azure Cloud Shell, type this command to open the `parameters.jso` file in `vim`. 

    ```powershell
    vim ./Provision/assets/parameters.json
    ```

    > `vim` essentials : [quick reference card](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/vimqrc.html)
    >
    > * `x` to delete characters
    > * `i` to insert characters
    > * `Esc` to get out of insertin mode
    > * `:qn` to save and exit
    > * `!:q` to exit without saving

    ![parameters.json before](Images/parameters-json-before.png)

2. Select first letter of **UNIQUE SMALL VALUE**, type `x` to delete letters, repeat to keep only quotation marks.

    ![parameters.json empty value](Images/parameters-json-empty.png)

3. Type `i` and enter a small unique value . This will be used for all asset names (cognitive services, storage accounts, web app and service plan, CosmosDB) so **make sure it's unique, only use lower case characters, type between 4 - 12 alphamerical characters**.

    > **yourunique2135** will likely not work as another one will probably have been taken by another user. I did.

    ![parameters.json empty value](Images/parameters-json-after.png)

4. Type `Esc` to quit insert mode. Type `:wq` to save and quit `vim`.

5. Type this command, and copy your **SubscriptionId**. Select it and type `Ctrl-insert`

    ```powershell
    ls Azure:
    ```

    > Under Azure: folder you can browse all assets of your current connected subscription like in a filesystem.

    ![copy SubcriptionId](Images/subscriptionId-list-copy.png)

6. Type these commands to launch the script that will create the assets.

    ```powershell
    cd .\Provision\assets\
    .\Deploy.ps1
    ```

    >  Use this values for each prompted variables:
    >
    >  * subscriptionId: Paste your copied **SubscriptionId** value from the previous step. Type `Shift-Insert` 
    >  * resourceGroupName: **customerreview**
    >  * deploymentName: **customerreview**

    ![Deploy all assets](Images/deploy-assets-parameters.png)

7. After a few seconds, type region: **West Europe**

    >  regions available for all assets:  East US, South Central US, North Europe, West Europe, Southeast Asia, West US 2

    ![Deploy all assets](Images/deploy-assets-region.png)

8. Wait a few minutes. Return to Azure portal, click to
    **Resource groups** > **Overview** > **customerreview** to follow assets provisioning.

    ![asset provisioning in portal](Images/deploy-assets-portal.png)

    At the end, the log should look like this one:

    ![Deploy all assets](Images/deploy-assets-log.png)

9. Open a new browser tab. Type this url http://**your_unique_name**site.azurewebsites.net

    > Site can take a few more minutes to be deployed by Kudu from this repo. This [document page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably) explains how to do it.


![web site deploying ](Images/deploy-assets-websitedeploying.png)

_Web site deploying_

> Web site is ready. But still empty and need some images. 

![web site deploying ](Images/deploy-assets-websiteready.png)

The assets are now all deployed and running. Now it's time to add some samples images to the web site.

<a name="Exercise4"></a>
## Exercise 4: Add images to CustomerReviews site (Reset data) ##

Your website is configured to get images from CosmosDB collections that you created in [Exercise 3](#Exercise3). These collections are not set, thus the Error on the web site. The `Reset` folder contains the scripts to set access to your CosmosDB and storage account. In this exercise, you will set collections, upload images to the CosmosDB, and reset any previous data.

1. In the Azure Cloud Shell, Type these commands.

    ```powershell
    cd ../Reset/
    .\SetConfigXmlParameters.ps1 -resourceGroup customerreview -uniqueKey your_unique_name
    ```

    > !Warning! replace **your_unique_name** by the value you used in [Exercise 3](#Exercise3)<br>
    > !Warning!  you might also replace **customerreview** by the resourceGroup name you used

2. Type this command.
   
    ```powershell
    vim config.xml
    ```

    > Make sure all uppercase values are replaced by values. DocumentDbKey must not be empty. 
    > If it's stay empty, you might have started `SetConfigParameters.ps1` when pasting the command. It's common. You can reset `config.xml` file by typing:<br>
    > `git checkout .\config.xml`  

    ![Set config.xml parameters](Images/reset-config-set.png)

3. Type `!:q` to exit `vim` without saving.Type `!:q` to exit `vim` without saving.

4. Type this command

    ```powershell
    ./setup/reset.azure.ps1 config.xml 
    ```

    > There may be some errors during cleaning as there are no collection in
    > CosmosDB set yet.

    ![clean up and add images](Images/reset-script-log.png)

5. Open a new browser tab. Type this url http://**your_unique_name**site.azurewebsites.net

    > You may need to force a refresh of the content, type `Ctrl-F5` .

## Summary ##

In this hands-on lab you learned how to:

- Create assets with Azure Resource Manager templates
- Execute PowerShell and Command srcipts in Azure Cloud Shell
- Use Azure Web Apps and deployment engine (Kudu) to automate build and deploy of a Web site from a GitHub repo.

This is just one example of how you can leverage Azure Resource Managemeer and Azure Cloud Shell to automate infrastructure. Experiment with other Azure Resource Manager templates to learn more about Azure Services and provisionning to identify additional ways in which they can aid your research or business.
